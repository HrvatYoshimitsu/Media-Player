# Python Media Player

Personal project to experiment creating a media player

## TODO List (no particular order)

* Select and play/pause an mp3 file
* Select and play/pause an mp4 file or other video formats
* Display information about current media file (i.e artist, album, length)
* Add ability to seek/skip to certain part of song (Also skip +10 seconds or custom amount)
* Import albums or directories
* Create playlists and be able to import/export them
* Shuffle/loop features
* Find mp3 files automatically on system (Specify directory to look for media)
* **Will add more if I see fit**
